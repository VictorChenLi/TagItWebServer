Image Recognition

--> Ideally, we'd have a program which automatically finds items of interest (puts boxes around them)
Otherwise: user manually creates the boxes
--> Once an item is selected in the image, the user inputs the brand (e.g., H&M, Guess, etc.) and the article of clothing (e.g., dress, watch, etc.)
--> Our program then finds the correct link using both the text input (brand + article) and the image selected

For our purposes, the image recognition software should do the following (Easiest down to most difficult):
Compare the colour (Note: Hue may vary based on type of lighting (natural, fake), camera type, lightness may vary based on amount of light)
Compare the pattern/texture (Note: May be hard to see if far enough away)
Compare large features (Is it a dress or a bag)
Compare more subtle features
